vMix Issues
===========

About
-----

StudioCoast's [vMix](https://www.vmix.com/) is a really awesome
commercial video mixing application for Windows. It provides tons of
great and stable functionality, and for a decent price compared to
the costs of te usual hardware/appliance-based solutions in the video
engineering field. Compared to the Open Source primary alternative OBS
Studio, vMix is more stable, but also somewhat less flexible (at least
when compared with the combo of OBS Studio and its [various third-party
plugins](https://github.com/rse/obs-setup/)). So, in practice, vMix is
the video engineering workhorse and OBS Studio the secret weapon for
special video streaming tasks.

Unfortunately, vMix has many nasty
[Limitations](https://github.com/rse/vmix-issues/labels/type-limitation),
even if most of them are "by design" according to
the vendor. And vMix even has some potential
[Bugs](https://github.com/rse/vmix-issues/labels/type-bug).
As a result the situation results in some high-level
[Wishes](https://github.com/rse/vmix-issues/labels/type-wish).

We are tracking those limitations, bugs and
wishes here and attached them to a [Project
Board](https://github.com/users/rse/projects/1/views/1). The primary
reason for this tracking is that without those limitations and bugs
closely kept in mind, one really regularly and quickly "runs into a
wall" when creating vMix presets for new types of events. And I finally
got really tired of having to remember all those issues...

PS: for some of the issues workarounds exist through my
[vMix Scripts](https://github.com/rse/vmix-scripts/) and
[vMix Assets](https://github.com/rse/vmix-assets/).
