vMix Issues
===========

vMix is an awesome video mixing application.
Nevertheless, there are known nasty [Limitations](https://github.com/rse/vmix-issues/labels/type-limitation),
known cruel [Bugs](https://github.com/rse/vmix-issues/labels/type-bug) and
[Wishes](https://github.com/rse/vmix-issues/labels/type-wish) we are
tracking here. They can be seen on a [Project Board](https://github.com/users/rse/projects/1/views/1), too.
The primary reason for this tracking is that without those kept in mind, one regularly "hits the wall"
when creating new vMix based presets.
Also, for some of the issues workarounds exists through my [vMix Scripts](https://github.com/rse/vmix-scripts/)
and [vMix Assets](https://github.com/rse/vmix-assets/).
