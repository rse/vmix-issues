vMix Issues
===========

vMix is an awesome video mixing application.
Nevertheless, there are known nasty [Limitations](https://github.com/rse/vmix-issues/labels/limitation),
known cruel [Bugs](https://github.com/rse/vmix-issues/labels/bug) and
wished [Enhancements](https://github.com/rse/vmix-issues/labels/enhacement) we are
tracking here in order to keep those in mind when creating vMix based presets.
