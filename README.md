vMix Issues
===========

[vMix](https://www.vmix.com/) is a really awesome video mixing application for Windows.
It provides tons of great and stable functionality and for a price which is cheap
compared to the costs of comparable hardware/appliance-based solutions in the video engineering field.
Compared to the Open Source primary alternative OBS Studio, vMix is also more stable,
but also less flexible. So, in practice, vMix is the video streaming workhorse and
OBS Studio the secret weapon for special tasks.

Unfortunately, vMix has many nasty [Limitations](https://github.com/rse/vmix-issues/labels/type-limitation),
and even some cruel [Bugs](https://github.com/rse/vmix-issues/labels/type-bug).
As a result the situation results in some high-level [Wishes](https://github.com/rse/vmix-issues/labels/type-wish).
We are tracking those limitations, bugs and wishes here and attached them to a [Project Board](https://github.com/users/rse/projects/1/views/1), too.
The primary reason for this tracking is that without those limitations and bugs kept in mind, one really regularly "runs into a wall"
when creating vMix presets for new type of events. And I finally got tired of remembering all those issues...

PS: for some of the issues workarounds exists through my [vMix Scripts](https://github.com/rse/vmix-scripts/)
and [vMix Assets](https://github.com/rse/vmix-assets/).
